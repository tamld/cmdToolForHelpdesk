# Contributing Guidelines

GitHub Workflow
- Large changes: open a Pull Request (PR) for review before merging.
- Small changes (docs tweaks, minor fixes): commit directly to main if low risk.
- Major bugs/refactors or release planning: open an Issue first and track progress there.
- Versioning: bump SemVer (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for big updates; include date in script header.

PR Expectations
- Describe scope, risks, and test/validation steps.
- Link related Issues and acceptance criteria.
- Keep changes minimal and reversible.

Branching
- Use short, descriptive branches: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `refactor/...`.

Code of Conduct
- Be concise, respectful, and review constructively.
