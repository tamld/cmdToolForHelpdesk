# === CONTEXT (WHY) - Answer "Why this approach?" ===
context:
  why_this_approach: |
    Enforce CARE spec structure (Context, Actions, Risks, Expectations) for all specs/ documentation.
    Rationale: Incomplete specs lead to unclear handoffs and implementation gaps (per LL-014).
    Approach: CI workflow + Bash lint script (simple, no dependencies) validates required headings on every push/PR.
  
  trade_offs:
    - decision: "Use Bash regex for heading detection"
      chosen: "Bash + grep/awk (simple, fast, CI-friendly)"
      rationale: "Avoid node/python deps for this small task; Markdown heading format is stable"
      evidence: "specs/13/plan.md (Actions section)"
    
    - decision: "Only validate presence of headings, not content quality"
      chosen: "Structural validation only"
      rationale: "Content quality review is human judgment; automation catches missing sections"
      evidence: "Risks section in specs/13/plan.md"
  
  attempted_but_failed:
    - "Initial CI trigger with path filters did not execute as expected."
    - "Linter failed due to incorrect heading levels (## vs #) in spec files."
  
  known_issues:
    - "Lint script may be fragile with non-standard Markdown (e.g., HTML headings, nested code blocks with # symbols)"
    - "No validation of metadata fields (task ID, author, status) yetâ€”deferred to future enhancement"
  
  dependencies:
    - external: "GitHub Actions (ubuntu-latest runner)"
    - internal: "specs/13/plan.md (defines CARE schema), .github/workflows/ (CI integration)"
