## Project-Specific Guidelines

- **Goal-Oriented Changes:** Each branch/PR is created to solve one overarching goal. All plans and actions must align with this goal.
- **Conflict Resolution:** If a plan or action conflicts with the overarching goal, I must pause and resolve the conflict, making assumptions only when necessary and explicitly stating them.
- **Reversibility:** Changes should be made in a way that allows for easy reversion or rollback. Avoid situations where changes are irreversible.
- **Semantic vs. Naming Convention:** Distinguish clearly between changes that are purely for naming convention standardization (e.g., `PascalCase`, `camelCase`) and those that alter the semantic meaning or logical structure of the code. Semantic changes require explicit user confirmation and careful consideration.
