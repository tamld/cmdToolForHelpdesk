    problem: "Sensitive context was previously pushed to GitHub."

    prevention:
      checklist:
        - "Keep raw brainstorm notes offline; publish sanitized summaries only."
        - "Audit remote branches periodically to confirm `.agents/` is absent."
        - "Reference offline evidence when responding to brainstorm requests."
    evidence:
      - "PR #55"
      - "branch_progress.yml milestone 2025-10-24"

    problem: "Successor lacked context because command output was not recorded."
    impact: "Follow-up sessions lost time recreating proof."
    prevention:
      checklist:
        - "Document commands and paths in `branch_progress.yml`."
        - "Store raw logs under `logs/<timestamp>/`."
        - "Update `.agents/records/decision_log.yml` whenever the plan changes."
    evidence:
      - "logs/session-20251024/ (local)"
      - "decision_log.yml entry DL-2025-10-24-01"
