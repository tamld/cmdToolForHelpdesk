    title: "First AI-Assisted Merge: CI Linter for CARE Specs"
    date: "2025-10-23"
    task_id: 13
    branch: "feature/ci-care-lint-13-agemini"
    description: "This milestone marks the first significant feature implemented and merged with AI agent assistance. The task involved creating a CI workflow to enforce documentation standards (CARE specs) across the project."
    outcome:
      - "A new CI workflow (`lint_care_spec.yml`) was created to automatically validate all `.md` files in the `specs/` directory."
      - "A bash script (`lint_care_spec.sh`) was developed to perform the validation logic."
      - "The workflow was successfully debugged and verified through multiple CI runs, confirming it correctly identifies both valid and invalid spec files."
    operational_method:
      - "Agent Handoff: Task was received from 'GitHub Copilot' by 'Gemini'."
      - "Autonomous Execution: 'Gemini' autonomously executed the implementation plan, including coding, testing, and debugging the CI workflow."
      - "AI-AI Collaboration: The process concludes with a handoff to 'Codex' for code review before merging."
