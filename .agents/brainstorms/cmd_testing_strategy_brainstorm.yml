  goal: |
    Choose the optimal testing strategy for CMD Tool For Helpdesk project.
    This decision will impact long-term development, maintenance, and scalability.
    We need to balance technical feasibility, resource requirements, and team collaboration.
  
  project_scope:
    - "Main script: Helpdesk-Tools.cmd (1,747 lines)"
    - "Refactor script: refactor.cmd (670 lines)"
    - "Package scripts: packages/*.cmd"
    - "Utility scripts: scripts/*.cmd"
    - "Target: Windows CMD environment"
    - "Deployment: CURL-friendly from GitHub"
  
  current_challenges:
    - "Host environment doesn't support CMD (macOS/Linux)"
    - "No existing testing framework for CMD scripts"
    - "Complex function dependencies and helper functions"
    - "Need to maintain CMD operating philosophy"
    - "Require reproducible testing across environments"

questions:
  - id: 1
    text: "What is the optimal testing infrastructure for CMD scripts?"
    category: "technical"
    priority: "high"
    context: |
      We need to test CMD scripts but our host environment (macOS/Linux) doesn't support CMD.
      Options include: Windows Container, GitHub Actions Windows Runner, WSL2, Docker-based, VM-based.
      Consider: compatibility, debugging, performance, maintenance overhead.
  
  - id: 2
    text: "How should we handle CMD script debugging and error reporting?"
    category: "operational"
    priority: "high"
    context: |
      CMD scripts have limited debugging capabilities compared to modern languages.
      We need effective error reporting, logging, and troubleshooting mechanisms.
      Consider: error capture, log aggregation, debugging tools, error recovery.

    text: "What are the long-term maintenance implications of each testing approach?"
    category: "strategic"
    priority: "medium"
    context: |
      This decision will affect the project for years to come.
      Consider: maintenance overhead, team knowledge requirements, scalability,
      cost implications, and adaptability to future changes.
  
  - id: 4
    text: "How should we structure function-level testing for CMD scripts?"
    category: "technical"
    priority: "high"
    context: |
      CMD scripts have complex function dependencies and helper functions.
      We need to test individual functions while preserving system integrity.
      Consider: function isolation, dependency mocking, test data management.

    text: "What are the resource requirements and cost implications?"
    category: "business"
    priority: "medium"
    context: |
      Different testing approaches have different resource requirements.
      Consider: CPU, RAM, disk space, network, licensing costs, maintenance time.
