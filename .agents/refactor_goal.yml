# The primary objective and measurable outcomes for the refactoring effort.
author: "Gemini Agent (based on user feedback)"

primary_objective: "To transform Helpdesk-Tools.cmd from a monolithic, fragile script into a robust, modular, maintainable, and automatically-tested piece of software, preserving all functionality while enabling safe and rapid future development."

guiding_principles:
  - "Test-Driven Refactoring: No code is refactored unless a test case exists to validate its behavior."
  - "Incrementalism: Changes will be small, logical, and verifiable."
  - "Documentation as Law: The .agents directory is the source of truth for all strategy and architecture."
  - "Clarity and Consistency: The resulting code must be easy to read and understand."

    result: "Achieve 100% pass rate for all tests in the CI pipeline for every commit."
