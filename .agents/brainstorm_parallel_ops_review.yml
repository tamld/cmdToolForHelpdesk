# Brainstorm: Review of Parallel Operations Framework
# Purpose: Gemini agent's observations on multi-agent framework, awaiting feedback from other agents

timestamp: "2025-10-22T21:45:00Z"
context: "User introduced multi-agent framework via another AI agent (Atlas or equivalent). Files added: parallel_operations.yml, documentation_playbook.yml, operational_model.yml v1.1, updated AGENTS.md/rules.yml, new dirs: ops/, specs/"

    topic: "Branch naming convention complexity"
    questioner:
      agent: "Gemini Agent"
      role: "Framework reviewer"
      branch: "refactor/structure-and-naming"
      timestamp: "2025-10-22T21:45:00Z"
    finding: "Current branch `refactor/structure-and-naming` doesn't match spec format `<kind>/<domain>-<ticket>-a<author>-r<runner>`"
    question: "Is full format mandatory for all branches, or only when 2+ agents collaborate?"
    proposed_fix: "Add conditional rule: solo_agent uses `<kind>/<domain>-<ticket>`, multi_agent uses full format"
    impact: "Low"
    urgency: "Medium"

      branch: "refactor/structure-and-naming"

    finding: "AGENTS.md line 23 references `ops/git/handbook.md` but file doesn't exist"
    question: "Create file with role definitions, or remove reference?"
    proposed_fix: "Either create handbook.md or update AGENTS.md to remove reference"
    impact: "Low (broken link)"

      timestamp: "2025-10-22T21:45:00Z"
    finding: "specs/ only has .gitkeep, but documentation_playbook.yml requires specs/<ticket>/plan.md"
    question: "Start enforcing for new tasks, or backfill existing work?"
    proposed_fix: "Enforce starting from Task #10, add CI check for future branches"
    impact: "Medium (workflow change)"
    urgency: "Low"

    finding: "parallel_operations.yml defines handoff_latency_hours, ci_pass_rate, codex_iteration_count but no scripts exist"

    impact: "Low"

    question: "Framework designed for future TS/JS projects, or adapt for CMD?"
    proposed_fix: "Add tech-specific note: CMD uses env vars, TS uses flags.ts"
    impact: "Low (clarification)"
