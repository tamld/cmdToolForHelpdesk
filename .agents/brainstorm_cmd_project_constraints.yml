# Multi-Agent Brainstorm: CMD Project Constraints & Framework Gaps
# Created: 2025-10-23
# Status: OPEN - Active Discussion Round 1
# Purpose: Deep analysis through reverse-thinking and multi-agent consensus

# ========================================================================
# WORKFLOW PROTOCOL (Read This First)
# ========================================================================
workflow:
  philosophy: |
    Brainstorming is NOT question-answer. It's a structured dialogue where:
    1. Questioner challenges assumptions with "reverse-thinking" prompts
    2. Responders provide evidence-based analysis (not just opinions)
    3. Artifacts emerge: decisions, lessons, consensus documents
    4. Process iterates until clarity or documented disagreement achieved
  
  rounds:
    - round: 1
      status: "In Progress"
      questioner: "GitHub Copilot CLI (Gemini backend)"
      goal: "Surface critical assumptions and gaps in framework"
      deliverable: "12 questions + initial proposals (SOL-001 to SOL-004)"
      
    - round: 2
      status: "Pending"
      responders: ["Gemini", "Codex", "Other agents"]
      goal: "Challenge proposals, provide alternatives, vote with evidence"
      deliverable: "AGREE/DISAGREE/CONDITIONAL responses with reasoning"
      
    - round: 3
      status: "Not Started"
      facilitator: "Human or consensus-building agent"
      goal: "Resolve conflicts, synthesize consensus, create artifacts"
      deliverable: "Lessons learned, core principles, operational updates"
  
  reverse_thinking_protocol:
    description: |
      Before proposing solutions, we ask "What if the opposite is true?"
      This prevents groupthink and uncovers hidden assumptions.
    
    examples:
      - question: "Should we create cmd_project_adaptations.yml?"
        reverse: "What if NO override file exists - how do agents adapt?"
        insight: "Forces us to think about inline documentation vs separate files"
      
      - question: "Should we enforce 48h merge SLA?"
        reverse: "What if branches NEVER have deadlines - what breaks?"
        insight: "Reveals true cost of stale branches vs flexibility value"

  evidence_requirements:
    description: "All claims must be verifiable - no hand-waving"
    acceptable:
      - "File path:line citations (e.g., parallel_operations.yml:22)"
      - "Git log evidence (e.g., commit SHA, branch age)"
      - "Command output (e.g., `ls contracts/` returns error)"
      - "Test results (e.g., CI run ID showing failure)"
    
    unacceptable:
      - "I think..." without supporting data
      - "Usually..." without project-specific examples
      - "Best practice says..." without context for THIS project
  
  conflict_resolution:
    - step: 1
      action: "Document disagreement in YAML with both positions"
      
    - step: 2
      action: "Identify root cause: different assumptions? missing data? value judgment?"
      
    - step: 3
      action: "Escalate to human if fundamental (e.g., risk tolerance, priorities)"
      
    - step: 4
      action: "If technical: run experiment, gather evidence, decide with data"

problem_statement: |
  Current .agents/ framework assumes Node.js/TypeScript conventions (contracts/, packages/config/flags.ts)
  but this is a pure CMD Batch script project. Need to clarify:
  
  1. How do multi-agent workflows adapt to CMD-specific constraints?
  2. What are the critical assumptions that could break collaboration?
  3. What guardrails need strengthening for this project type?

observations:
  - id: OBS-001
    agent: "GitHub Copilot CLI"
    timestamp: "2025-10-23T10:15:00Z"
    topic: "Framework-Project Mismatch"
    evidence: |
      File: .agents/parallel_operations.yml:22-26
      ```yaml
      requirements:
        - "Contracts live under `contracts/` and must be versioned..."
        - "Feature flags defined in `packages/config/flags.ts`..."
      ```
      
      Reality: This CMD project has NO contracts/, NO packages/, NO TypeScript.
      Current structure:
        - Helpdesk-Tools.cmd (monolithic, ~2000 lines)
        - tests/ (integration tests via log parsing)
        - specs/ (CARE-formatted markdown)
        - .agents/ (framework docs)
    
    concern: |
      If Agent B reads parallel_operations.yml literally, they may:
      - Create unnecessary Node.js scaffolding
      - Misunderstand feature flag mechanism (should use ENV vars in CMD)
      - Look for contracts that don't exist
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q1: Should we create a CMD-specific override file like `.agents/cmd_adaptations.yml`?
      Q2: Or should we generalize parallel_operations.yml with conditional sections?
      Q3: How do other agents handle domain-specific projects that don't match framework defaults?

    timestamp: "2025-10-23T10:20:00Z"
    topic: "Test Validity vs Framework Promises"
    evidence: |
      File: .agents/testing_strategy.yml:9-17
      Promises "Multi-layered Testing: Unit → Integration → E2E"
      
      Reality (from earlier analysis):
      - Current tests only verify UI strings in log files (findstr)
      - No actual system modification validation (no VM environment)
      - False confidence: CI passing ≠ functionality working
    
    concern: |
      Branch refactor/robust-testing shows "In Progress" in backlog but tests are incomplete.
      If Agent B picks up testing tasks, they may assume infrastructure exists.
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q4: Should we add a CRITICAL WARNING in testing_strategy.yml about current limitations?
      Q5: Do we need a separate `testing_reality.yml` vs `testing_vision.yml`?
      Q6: How do agents distinguish between "aspirational docs" vs "current capabilities"?

    timestamp: "2025-10-23T10:25:00Z"
    topic: "Branch Lifecycle Confusion"
    evidence: |
      Current branches:
      - refactor/structure-and-naming (DONE but not merged)
      - refactor/robust-testing (In Progress but incomplete)
      - feature/ci-care-lint-13-agemini (DONE and merged)
      
      Backlog shows:
      - Task #11 DONE (naming convention) - but branch not merged yet
      - No clear "merge checklist" in AGENTS.md
    
    concern: |
      Stale branches create confusion. Agent B may:
      - Not know which is source of truth (main vs feature branch)
      - Duplicate work if they don't check branch status
      - Create merge conflicts
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q7: Should we mandate "merge within 24h of marking DONE" in core_principles.yml?
      Q8: Do we need automated branch staleness alerts?
      Q9: Who owns the responsibility to merge (author agent or reviewer)?

    topic: "Phase Prioritization Ambiguity"
    evidence: |
      User stated: "Core value is refactor menus/structure, not logic validation"
      
      But roadmap.yml Phase 1 includes:
      - "Basic Verification Procedures"
      - "Robust Error Handling"
      
      And backlog.yml has:
      - Task #5: "Enforce Dispatcher Pattern" (Priority: Critical)
      - Task #6: "Refactor All Menus" (Priority: High)
      
      Conflict: Dispatcher needed for testing, but user says focus on structure first.
    
    concern: |
      Different agents may prioritize differently based on which doc they read first.
      Testing-focused agent may push for Task #5 (Dispatcher).
      Structure-focused agent may ignore testing completely.
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q10: Should backlog.yml have explicit phase gates (no Task #5 until #17, #18 done)?
      Q11: Do we need a "BLOCKED_BY" field in backlog tasks?
      Q12: How do agents resolve priority conflicts between roadmap and backlog?

      current_limitations:
        infrastructure: "No VM/sandbox for actual system modifications"

        name: "Merge Velocity Principle"
        description: "Completed work must be integrated quickly to avoid drift"
        implementation: |
          - Tasks marked DONE must be merged within 48 hours
          - Author agent responsible for merge (or delegation to Codex)
          - Stale branches (>7 days inactive) trigger auto-notification

# CRITICAL QUESTIONS (With Reverse-Thinking Prompts)
# ========================================================================
critical_questions:
  - question_id: CQ-001
    category: "Framework Adaptation"
    question: "How do you verify project type before applying framework defaults?"
    current_gap: "No detection mechanism in operational_model.yml"
    
    reverse_thinking:
      prompt: "What if we DON'T detect project type - what fails?"
      scenarios:
        - "Agent assumes Node.js → creates package.json → wasted effort"
        - "Agent assumes contracts/ exist → error, backtrack"
        - "Agent uses wrong testing strategy → false confidence"
      insight: "Type detection is CRITICAL - not nice-to-have"
    
    depth_questions:
      - "How granular? (CMD vs Bash vs PowerShell? Or just 'shell scripting'?)"
      - "Where to store type info? (File marker? Convention? Explicit config?)"
      - "What if project is hybrid (CMD + PowerShell modules)?"
    
    stakeholders:
      - agent: "Gemini"
        why: "May have seen diverse project types in other repos"
      - agent: "Codex"
        why: "Cloud execution - may need type detection for sandbox config"
  
  - question_id: CQ-002
    category: "Documentation Honesty"
    question: "What's your protocol when documentation promises exceed actual capabilities?"
    current_gap: "testing_strategy.yml promised 'multi-layer testing' but only has UI smoke tests"
    
    reverse_thinking:
      prompt: "What if we DON'T document limitations - what happens?"
      scenarios:
        - "Agent refactors business logic assuming tests will catch bugs"
        - "PR merged with 'all tests passing' but production breaks"
        - "Trust in CI/CD eroded when failures occur despite green builds"
      insight: "Honesty > optimism - better to under-promise and over-deliver"
    
    depth_questions:
      - "How to distinguish 'aspirational' vs 'current' in docs?"

    reverse_thinking:
      prompt: "What if we NEVER escalate conflicts - agents decide independently?"
      scenarios:
