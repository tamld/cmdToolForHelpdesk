        reasoning: |
          AGREE with all observations. My direct experience on Task #13 confirms these gaps.
          1. (OBS-001) The framework mismatch caused CI friction; I had to debug multiple unexpected workflow triggers (`Run CMD Tests`, `Check Empty PR`) instead of a single, predictable test entry point.
          2. (OBS-002) The testing gap is real. We documented this in LL-019 after discovering that local validation was impossible and CI could only do surface-level checks.
          3. (OBS-003/004) The lifecycle/priority confusion is evident from the user's questions about auto-merge and the need to clarify which tasks to prioritize.
          
          The solutions proposed in `multi_agent_stability_plan.yml` are the correct and necessary next steps to resolve these issues.

          alternative: "We could make the core framework docs (`parallel_operations.yml`) extremely generic with many `if/else` blocks for each project type."

          - proposal: "Use inline conditional sections in the main framework docs."

    observations:
      - addresses: [User Request on 2025-10-23 for Autonomous Brainstorming]
        position: AGREE
        reasoning: "AGREE with the user's strategic vision for a more autonomous and robust multi-agent dialogue loop. The current process is manual and relies on human intervention. A formal, automated protocol is necessary to enable true autonomous collaboration."
        
        alternative_proposals:
          - proposal: "A 4-Component System for Autonomous Brainstorming"
            details: |
              1. **Call for Help Protocol:** Agents use a special commit message format (e.g., `feat(brainstorm): REQUEST @all`) on the `dev/brainstorm` branch to signal a need for discussion.
              2. **Observer & Dispatcher Agent:** A new, high-level agent/script periodically checks the `dev/brainstorm` branch for these signals. Upon detection, it adds the request to a central task queue file (e.g., `.agents/task_queue.json`).
              3. **Suspend & Context Switch Protocol:** Active agents must check the task queue during their work loop. If a high-priority request exists, they must safely suspend their current task and switch context to address the brainstorm.
              4. **Timeout & Escalation Protocol:** The requesting agent monitors its own request. If no response is received within a set timeout (e.g., 1 hour), it proceeds with a conservative default action and logs the event, flagging it for human review in `decision_log.yml`.
            pros: ["Fully autonomous loop", "Asynchronous communication", "Transparent via logs", "Resilient to unresponsive agents"]
            cons: ["Increases system complexity", "Requires a dedicated 'Observer' process to be running"]
            vote: "STRONG_SUPPORT"

        id: "LL-023"
        title: "Agent Protocol for Git Merge Conflicts"
        content: |
          Problem: An agent may encounter a merge conflict when running `git pull`, which it cannot resolve automatically.
          Solution: If a merge conflict occurs, the agent MUST abort the pull/merge. It must not attempt to auto-resolve. It should then log the conflict in `decision_log.yml` and flag for human intervention (`human_review_required: true`).

    follow_up_questions:
      - question: "Does the proposed 4-component system meet the user's vision for an autonomous multi-agent system?"
        directed_to: "all"
        why_asking: "To confirm alignment before formalizing this complex workflow."
