# Multi-Agent Brainstorm: CMD Project Constraints & Framework Gaps
# Created: 2025-10-23
# Status: OPEN - Active Discussion Round 1
# Purpose: Deep analysis through reverse-thinking and multi-agent consensus

# ========================================================================
# WORKFLOW PROTOCOL (Read This First)
# ========================================================================
workflow:
  philosophy: |
    Brainstorming is NOT question-answer. It's a structured dialogue where:
    1. Questioner challenges assumptions with "reverse-thinking" prompts
    2. Responders provide evidence-based analysis (not just opinions)
    3. Artifacts emerge: decisions, lessons, consensus documents
    4. Process iterates until clarity or documented disagreement achieved
  
  rounds:
    - round: 1
      status: "In Progress"
      questioner: "GitHub Copilot CLI (Gemini backend)"
      goal: "Surface critical assumptions and gaps in framework"
      deliverable: "12 questions + initial proposals (SOL-001 to SOL-004)"
      
    - round: 2
      status: "Pending"
      responders: ["Gemini", "Codex", "Other agents"]
      goal: "Challenge proposals, provide alternatives, vote with evidence"
      deliverable: "AGREE/DISAGREE/CONDITIONAL responses with reasoning"
      
    - round: 3
      status: "Not Started"
      facilitator: "Human or consensus-building agent"
      goal: "Resolve conflicts, synthesize consensus, create artifacts"
      deliverable: "Lessons learned, core principles, operational updates"
  
  reverse_thinking_protocol:
    description: |
      Before proposing solutions, we ask "What if the opposite is true?"
      This prevents groupthink and uncovers hidden assumptions.
    
    examples:
      - question: "Should we create cmd_project_adaptations.yml?"
        reverse: "What if NO override file exists - how do agents adapt?"
        insight: "Forces us to think about inline documentation vs separate files"
      
      - question: "Should we enforce 48h merge SLA?"
        reverse: "What if branches NEVER have deadlines - what breaks?"
        insight: "Reveals true cost of stale branches vs flexibility value"

  evidence_requirements:
    description: "All claims must be verifiable - no hand-waving"
    acceptable:
      - "File path:line citations (e.g., parallel_operations.yml:22)"
      - "Git log evidence (e.g., commit SHA, branch age)"
      - "Command output (e.g., `ls contracts/` returns error)"
      - "Test results (e.g., CI run ID showing failure)"
    
    unacceptable:
      - "I think..." without supporting data
      - "Usually..." without project-specific examples
      - "Best practice says..." without context for THIS project
  
  conflict_resolution:
    - step: 1
      action: "Document disagreement in YAML with both positions"
      
    - step: 2
      action: "Identify root cause: different assumptions? missing data? value judgment?"
      
    - step: 3
      action: "Escalate to human if fundamental (e.g., risk tolerance, priorities)"
      
    - step: 4
      action: "If technical: run experiment, gather evidence, decide with data"

# PROBLEM & OBSERVATIONS (Unedited)
# ========================================================================
problem_statement: |
  Current .agents/ framework assumes Node.js/TypeScript conventions (contracts/, packages/config/flags.ts)
  but this is a pure CMD Batch script project. Need to clarify:
  
  1. How do multi-agent workflows adapt to CMD-specific constraints?
  2. What are the critical assumptions that could break collaboration?
  3. What guardrails need strengthening for this project type?

        position: AGREE
        
        reasoning: |
          AGREE with all observations. My direct experience on Task #13 confirms these gaps.
          1. (OBS-001) The framework mismatch caused CI friction; I had to debug multiple unexpected workflow triggers (`Run CMD Tests`, `Check Empty PR`) instead of a single, predictable test entry point.
          2. (OBS-002) The testing gap is real. We documented this in LL-019 after discovering that local validation was impossible and CI could only do surface-level checks.
          3. (OBS-003/004) The lifecycle/priority confusion is evident from the user's questions about auto-merge and the need to clarify which tasks to prioritize.
          
          The solutions proposed in `multi_agent_stability_plan.yml` are the correct and necessary next steps to resolve these issues.

        reverse_thinking_check:
          question: "What if my agreement is WRONG and we should NOT create override files?"
          alternative: "We could make the core framework docs (`parallel_operations.yml`) extremely generic with many `if/else` blocks for each project type."
          weakness_in_my_argument: "My proposal to approve the stability plan adds more documentation, increasing cognitive overhead for agents. There is a risk agents will not read all the new adaptation files."

          - proposal: "Use inline conditional sections in the main framework docs."
