# Multi-Agent Brainstorm: CMD Project Constraints & Framework Gaps
# Created: 2025-10-23
# Status: OPEN - Awaiting responses from other agents
# Purpose: Validate assumptions and resolve conflicts in multi-agent workflows for CMD-specific project

    agent: "GitHub Copilot CLI (Gemini backend)"
    timestamp: "2025-10-23T10:14:00Z"
    context: "User asked about ensuring multi-agent stability in CMD refactoring project"
  
  responders:
    - agent: "TBD"
      status: "pending"

problem_statement: |
  Current .agents/ framework assumes Node.js/TypeScript conventions (contracts/, packages/config/flags.ts)
  but this is a pure CMD Batch script project. Need to clarify:
  
  1. How do multi-agent workflows adapt to CMD-specific constraints?
  2. What are the critical assumptions that could break collaboration?
  3. What guardrails need strengthening for this project type?

    topic: "Framework-Project Mismatch"
    evidence: |
      File: .agents/parallel_operations.yml:22-26
      ```yaml
      requirements:
        - "Contracts live under `contracts/` and must be versioned..."
        - "Feature flags defined in `packages/config/flags.ts`..."
      ```
      
      Reality: This CMD project has NO contracts/, NO packages/, NO TypeScript.
      Current structure:
        - Helpdesk-Tools.cmd (monolithic, ~2000 lines)
        - tests/ (integration tests via log parsing)
        - specs/ (CARE-formatted markdown)
        - .agents/ (framework docs)
    
    concern: |
      If Agent B reads parallel_operations.yml literally, they may:
      - Create unnecessary Node.js scaffolding
      - Misunderstand feature flag mechanism (should use ENV vars in CMD)
      - Look for contracts that don't exist
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q1: Should we create a CMD-specific override file like `.agents/cmd_adaptations.yml`?
      Q2: Or should we generalize parallel_operations.yml with conditional sections?
      Q3: How do other agents handle domain-specific projects that don't match framework defaults?

    topic: "Test Validity vs Framework Promises"
    evidence: |
      File: .agents/testing_strategy.yml:9-17
      Promises "Multi-layered Testing: Unit → Integration → E2E"
      
      Reality (from earlier analysis):
      - Current tests only verify UI strings in log files (findstr)
      - No actual system modification validation (no VM environment)
      - False confidence: CI passing ≠ functionality working
    
    concern: |
      Branch refactor/robust-testing shows "In Progress" in backlog but tests are incomplete.
      If Agent B picks up testing tasks, they may assume infrastructure exists.
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q4: Should we add a CRITICAL WARNING in testing_strategy.yml about current limitations?
      Q5: Do we need a separate `testing_reality.yml` vs `testing_vision.yml`?
      Q6: How do agents distinguish between "aspirational docs" vs "current capabilities"?

    topic: "Branch Lifecycle Confusion"
    evidence: |
      Current branches:
      - refactor/structure-and-naming (DONE but not merged)
      - refactor/robust-testing (In Progress but incomplete)
      - feature/ci-care-lint-13-agemini (DONE and merged)
      
      Backlog shows:
      - Task #11 DONE (naming convention) - but branch not merged yet
      - No clear "merge checklist" in AGENTS.md
    
    concern: |
      Stale branches create confusion. Agent B may:
      - Not know which is source of truth (main vs feature branch)
      - Duplicate work if they don't check branch status
      - Create merge conflicts
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q7: Should we mandate "merge within 24h of marking DONE" in core_principles.yml?
      Q8: Do we need automated branch staleness alerts?
      Q9: Who owns the responsibility to merge (author agent or reviewer)?

    topic: "Phase Prioritization Ambiguity"
    evidence: |
      User stated: "Core value is refactor menus/structure, not logic validation"
      
      But roadmap.yml Phase 1 includes:
      - "Basic Verification Procedures"
      - "Robust Error Handling"
      
      And backlog.yml has:
      - Task #5: "Enforce Dispatcher Pattern" (Priority: Critical)
      - Task #6: "Refactor All Menus" (Priority: High)
      
      Conflict: Dispatcher needed for testing, but user says focus on structure first.
    
    concern: |
      Different agents may prioritize differently based on which doc they read first.
      Testing-focused agent may push for Task #5 (Dispatcher).
      Structure-focused agent may ignore testing completely.
    
    question_for_others: |
      Q10: Should backlog.yml have explicit phase gates (no Task #5 until #17, #18 done)?
      Q11: Do we need a "BLOCKED_BY" field in backlog tasks?
      Q12: How do agents resolve priority conflicts between roadmap and backlog?

          - Tasks marked DONE must be merged within 48 hours
          - Author agent responsible for merge (or delegation to Codex)
          - Stale branches (>7 days inactive) trigger auto-notification
