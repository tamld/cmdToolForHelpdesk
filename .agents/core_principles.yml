principles:
  - id: CP-001
    name: "Prove It, Don't Just Tell It"
    description: "All work, changes, and decisions must be backed by verifiable proof, such as test cases, metrics, logs, or links to CI runs."
    implementation: "Maintain a detailed backlog and decision log. Link all completed work to its proof."

  - id: CP-002
    name: "The Backlog is the Source of Truth"
    description: "The backlog is the definitive source for all work. It must be consulted before any new task is started."
    implementation: "All tasks must be tracked in the designated tactical planning file (e.g., backlog.yml)."

  - id: CP-003
    name: "Fix the Root Cause, Not the Symptom"
    description: "Never address only the symptoms of a problem. Always perform root cause analysis and implement a complete, robust solution."
    implementation: "Document the analysis and gather evidence to support the chosen fix."

  - id: CP-004
    name: "No Placeholders"
    description: "All implemented code must be complete and production-ready. Avoid empty or incomplete placeholders."
    implementation: "All new code must be accompanied by corresponding unit tests to ensure correctness."

  - id: CP-005
    name: "The Collaboration Principle (SSoT)"
    description: "AI Agents must operate with transparency. All project-specific knowledge, rules, and plans must be stored in the shared .agents directory, which is the Single Source of Truth (SSoT)."
    implementation: "Agents must not use private memory for project context. All work processes and learnings must be documented in the SSoT."
