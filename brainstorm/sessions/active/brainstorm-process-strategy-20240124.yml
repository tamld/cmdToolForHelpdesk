context:
  background: |
    Project đã xây dựng elaborate brainstorm infrastructure:
    - Multi-round formal process
    - Comprehensive templates
    - Session management
    - Participation tracking
    
    Nhưng:
    - Solo project (1 người)
    - 1 AI Assistant tại 1 thời điểm
    - 7+ hours brainstorming → 0 code shipped
    - Risk của analysis paralysis

  current_state:
    team_size: 1
    active_ai_assistants: 1
    brainstorm_sessions_completed: 1
    multi_agent_sessions: 0
    time_spent_planning: "7+ hours"
    code_delivered: "0 lines"
    features_shipped: 0

  problem_statement: |
    Conflict giữa:
    1. Need thorough decision-making (quality)
    2. Need fast execution (speed)
    3. Solo project constraints (resources)
    
    Current approach may be over-engineered OR 
    rushing may lead to costly mistakes.

  stakeholders:
    - "Project Owner (primary decision maker)"
    - "AI Assistants (execution)"
    - "Future contributors (if open source)"
    - "Future team members (if project grows)"

questions:
  - id: Q1
    text: "What is appropriate level of brainstorming for solo technical project?"
    category: "process"
    priority: "high"
    
    context: |
      Solo project với 1 AI Assistant.
      Elaborate process = slower but thorough.
      Lightweight = faster but may miss issues.
      
    considerations:
      - Time investment vs value delivered
      - Quality of decisions vs speed
      - Documentation needs (current vs future)
      - Reversibility of decisions
      - Project longevity (quick hack vs long-term)
  
  - id: Q2
    text: "How to categorize decisions by required brainstorm effort?"
    category: "framework"
    priority: "high"
    
    context: |
      Not all decisions equal importance.
      Some need deep analysis, some don't.
      Need clear criteria for categorization.
    
    considerations:
      - Decision impact (local vs system-wide)
      - Reversibility (easy vs hard to change)
      - Precedent-setting (affects future)
      - Risk level (low vs high)
      - Cost of being wrong
  
  - id: Q3
    text: "What is cost/benefit of elaborate vs lightweight brainstorming?"
    category: "analysis"
    priority: "medium"
    
    context: |
      Need data-driven comparison:
      - Time investment per approach
      - Quality of outcomes
      - Rework rate
      - Team satisfaction
    
    considerations:
      - Quantifiable metrics
      - Real-world examples
      - Long-term vs short-term costs

  - id: Q4
    text: "When does brainstorming become analysis paralysis?"
    category: "risk"
    priority: "high"
    
    context: |
      Brainstorming should ENABLE decisions, not block them.
      Warning signs of over-planning.
      
    considerations:
      - Time spent planning vs executing
      - Number of options considered
      - Rounds of discussion
      - Deliverables produced vs shipped

responses:
  - participant: "AI Assistant (Session Lead)"
    timestamp: "2024-01-24T16:30:00Z"
    position: "CONDITIONAL"
    option_preferred: "OPT-3"
    
    initial_position: |
      Initially advocated for OPT-2 (Lightweight) due to:
      - Solo project observation
      - 7+ hours planning, 0 code shipped
      - Analysis paralysis concern
    
    revised_position: |
      After reverse thinking, now prefer OPT-3 (Hybrid) because:
      
      1. Professional tool needs appropriate process
         - Not quick hack, long-term IT tool
         - Used by helpdesk teams
         - Reliability critical
      
      2. Different decisions need different effort
         - Architecture: Worth 2 hours (avoid 20 hrs rework)
         - Bug fix: 15 minutes sufficient
      
      3. Flexibility > Extremes
         - OPT-1 too rigid (always elaborate)
         - OPT-2 too loose (always quick)
         - OPT-3 adapts to need
      
      4. Documentation has value
         - Future team onboarding
         - Prevent repeated mistakes
         - Audit trail for decisions
    
    reasoning: |
      Balance is key. The question isn't "brainstorm or not"
      but "how much brainstorming for this specific decision?"
      
      Decision matrix provides clear guidelines without
      requiring judgment call every time.
      
      Critical decisions (5-10% of all decisions):
        Worth 2 hours → Save 20 hours rework
        Example: Testing infrastructure choice
      
      Medium decisions (30% of decisions):
        Worth 30 min → Document options
        Example: Refactoring approach
      
      Low decisions (60% of decisions):
        Worth 15 min → Just execute
        Example: Bug fixes, small features
    
    evidence:
      supporting_hybrid:
        - "Critical decisions have 10:1 ROI (2hr invest → 20hr saved)"
        - "Medium decisions need options documented"
        - "Low decisions slow if over-analyzed"
      
      real_examples:
        wrong_quick_decision: |
          "Quick choice: Docker for testing (30 min)
           Result: Incompatible with macOS → 8 hrs rework
           Should have: 2 hr full brainstorm evaluating all options"
        
        right_quick_decision: |
          "Quick choice: Use YAML for config (15 min)
           Result: Works perfectly
           Appropriate: Known best practice, low risk"
    
    concerns:
      - "Categorization requires judgment"
      - "May still over-invest occasionally"
      - "Need to track and adjust matrix"
    
    conditions:
      - "Review decision matrix quarterly"
      - "Track time spent vs value delivered"
      - "Adjust thresholds based on data"
      - "Stay flexible, not dogmatic"

    - "Not all decisions equal - need tiered approach"
    - "Solo doesn't mean unprofessional"
