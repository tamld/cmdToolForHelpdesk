# CONTEXT
# ========================================================================

context:
  background: |
    Infrastructure cho multi-agent collaboration đã được xây dựng:
    - Agent profiles
    - Availability tracking
    - Participation logging
    - Session management
    - Handoff protocols
    
    Nhưng:
    - Current team: 1 người
    - AI Assistants: 1 tại 1 thời điểm
    - Multi-agent sessions: 0
    - Actual usage: 0%
    - Maintenance: ~1 hour/week

  current_state:
    team_composition:
      humans: 1
      ai_assistants_concurrent: 1
      ai_assistants_total: 1
    
    infrastructure:
      built: true
      documented: true
      tested: false
      used: false
    
    metrics:
      multi_agent_sessions: 0
      collaboration_events: 0
      time_spent_maintaining: "0 hours (newly built)"
      value_delivered: 0

  problem_statement: |
    Classic YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) vs 
    "Be Prepared" debate:
    
    1. Build infrastructure now when calm?
       - Takes 2-3 hours to build properly
       - Can test and refine
       - Ready when needed
       - But may never need it
    
    2. Defer until actually needed?
       - Zero overhead now
       - Focus on features
       - Build if/when team grows
       - But emergency setup = poor quality

  stakeholders:
    - "Project Owner (decides team size)"
    - "Current AI Assistant (uses infrastructure)"
    - "Future AI Assistants (may collaborate)"
    - "Future team members"

questions:
  - id: Q1
    text: "When should infrastructure be built: before need or when needed?"
    category: "strategy"
    priority: "medium"
    
    context: |
      YAGNI principle says: "Don't build until you need it"
      Pragmatic principle says: "Prep work avoids emergency poor quality"
      
    considerations:
      - Setup time required (2-3 hours)
      - Maintenance overhead (1 hr/week)
      - Likelihood of need (unknown)
      - Emergency setup quality (likely poor)
      - Cost of not having when urgent
  
  - id: Q2
    text: "Is solo practice valuable for testing infrastructure?"
    category: "testing"
    priority: "low"
    
    context: |
      Could use multi-agent infrastructure solo to:
      - Test workflows
      - Find issues
      - Refine process
      - Build muscle memory
      
      But also:
      - Overhead for no immediate value
      - Solo ≠ real multi-agent dynamics
      - May give false confidence
    
    considerations:
      - Practice value vs overhead
      - Solo testing vs real usage differences
      - Time investment (15 min/month)
  
  - id: Q3
    text: "What are reactivation costs for mothballed infrastructure?"
    category: "analysis"
    priority: "medium"
    
    context: |
      If we mothball infrastructure and need it later:
      - Review archived files (30 min)
      - Update for current context (30 min)
      - Test and debug (1-2 hours)
      - Train team (1 hour)
      
      Total: 3-4 hours
      
      Vs building fresh: 2-3 hours (less if patterns exist)
    
    considerations:
      - Reactivation effort
      - Risk of outdated infrastructure
      - Fresh vs revive trade-offs

  - id: Q4
    text: "How likely is team to grow in next 6-12 months?"
    category: "planning"
    priority: "high"
    
    context: |
      Infrastructure value depends on probability of use.
      
      If team likely to grow:
        - Keep infrastructure
        - Practice occasionally
        - Ready when needed
      
      If team unlikely to grow:
        - Mothball infrastructure
        - Minimal overhead
        - Build if actually needed
    
    considerations:
      - Project roadmap
      - Funding/resources
      - Growth plans
      - Open source community

  - participant: "AI Assistant (Session Lead)"
    timestamp: "2024-01-24T17:00:00Z"
    position: "CONDITIONAL"
    option_preferred: "OPT-3"
    
    initial_position: |
      Initially advocated for OPT-2 (Mothball) due to:
      - YAGNI principle
      - Zero current usage
      - Solo project reality
      - Want to minimize overhead
    
    revised_position: |
      After reverse thinking, now prefer OPT-3 (Lightweight Active):
      
      1. Emergency setup risk
         - When you NEED multi-agent, usually urgent
         - No time for 3-hour quality setup
         - Rushed setup = poor quality
         - Better: Already familiar, quick activation
      
      2. Practice value underestimated
         - Solo practice tests infrastructure
         - Find issues in low-stakes environment
         - Build muscle memory
         - 15 min/month = acceptable overhead
      
      3. Reactivation costs
         - OPT-2: 3-4 hours reactivation (cold)
         - OPT-3: 30 min - 1 hour (warm)
         - Difference: 2-3 hours saved when urgent
         - 15 min/month × 12 months = 3 hours/year
         - Break-even if need infrastructure once/year
      
      4. Professional standards
         - Helpdesk tool used by IT teams
         - Professional appearance matters
         - Infrastructure readiness = competence signal
    
    reasoning: |
      The key insight: "Stay warm, not hot"
      
      NOT maintaining active (OPT-1):
        - Too much overhead (50 hrs/year)
        - Over-kill for current needs
      
      NOT completely mothballed (OPT-2):
        - Rusty when needed (3-4 hr reactivation)
        - Emergency setup quality poor
      
      Lightweight active (OPT-3):
        - Minimal overhead (3 hrs/year)
        - Familiar when needed (30 min activation)
        - Best balance
    
    evidence:
      supporting_lightweight_active:
        - "Reactivation time: OPT-2=3-4hrs, OPT-3=30min"
        - "Maintenance: OPT-1=50hrs/yr, OPT-3=3hrs/yr"
        - "Break-even: 1 reactivation/year"
      
      real_scenario:
        urgent_need: |
          "Scenario: Client deadline, need 2 AAs parallel
           
           With OPT-2 (Mothball):
             - Realize need infrastructure: panic
             - Read archived docs: 30 min
             - Setup and test: 2-3 hours
             - Debug issues: 1 hour
             - Total: 3-4 hours delay
             - Quality: Rushed, may have issues
           
           With OPT-3 (Lightweight Active):
             - Already familiar: calm
             - Review simple handoff: 10 min
             - Activate coordination: 20 min
             - Total: 30 min delay
             - Quality: Tested, confident"
    
    concerns:
      - "15 min/month overhead still feels wasteful if never need"
      - "Solo practice ≠ real multi-agent dynamics"
      - "May build false confidence"
    
    conditions:
      - "If project stays solo for 2+ years → revisit"
      - "If overhead feels burdensome → mothball"
      - "If team grows → expand infrastructure"
    
    alternative_view: |
      Devil's advocate against my position:
      
      "Why keep infrastructure if 50% chance never needed?
       - 3 hrs/year × 2 years = 6 hours invested
       - If never need = 6 hours wasted
       - Could have built fresh in 3 hours when needed
       - Net loss: 3 hours
       
       Counter: But if DO need:
       - OPT-3: 30 min activation
       - OPT-2: 3-4 hour activation
       - Difference: 3 hours saved
       - Plus: Better quality (not rushed)
       - Plus: Less stress
       
       Expected value calculation:
       - Probability need: 50%
       - Cost maintain: 6 hrs/2yr
       - Savings if need: 3 hrs + quality
       - Expected: 50% × 3 hrs = 1.5 hrs saved
       - Vs cost: 6 hrs
       - Net: -4.5 hrs
       
       Hmm... Devil's advocate may be right!
       Maybe OPT-2 (Mothball) better after all?"

    reasoning: |
      This is genuine uncertainty, not clear answer.
      
      Expected value calculation:
      
      For OPT-2 (Mothball):
        Cost: 0 hrs maintenance
        Reactivation: 3-4 hrs if needed
        Expected: P(need) × 3.5 hrs
        
        If P(need) = 30%: 0.3 × 3.5 = 1.05 hrs
        If P(need) = 50%: 0.5 × 3.5 = 1.75 hrs
      
      For OPT-3 (Lightweight Active):
        Cost: 3 hrs/year maintenance
        Reactivation: 0.5 hrs if needed
        Expected: 3 + P(need) × 0.5
        
        If P(need) = 30%: 3 + 0.15 = 3.15 hrs
        If P(need) = 50%: 3 + 0.25 = 3.25 hrs
      
      Break-even analysis:
        OPT-2 better if: P(need) < 46%
        OPT-3 better if: P(need) > 46%
      
      But wait... Quality factor!
      
      Emergency setup (OPT-2):
        - Rushed = poor quality
        - Issues likely
        - Additional 1-2 hrs debugging
        - Total: 4-6 hrs (not 3-4)
      
      Practiced setup (OPT-3):
        - Tested = confident
        - Smooth activation
        - Total: 0.5 hrs as estimated
      
      Revised break-even: P(need) > 33%
      
      Conclusion: Depends on growth probability
    
    concerns: |
      - "Don't know real P(need) probability"
      - "Solo practice may not reveal real issues"
      - "Overhead may accumulate (scope creep)"
      - "May never need it (waste)"
    
    question_for_owner: |
      "What is your estimate for needing multi-agent collaboration
       in next 6-12 months?"
       
       Factors to consider:
       - Plan to hire someone?
       - Open source contributors expected?
       - Project complexity growing?
       - Parallel development needed?
       - Large features requiring split work?
       
       If >= 30% probability: OPT-3 recommended
       If < 30% probability: OPT-2 recommended
    
    alternative_view: |
      Devil's advocate:
      
      "Even at 50% probability, OPT-2 may be better:
       - 3 hrs/year overhead is REAL cost (paid now)
       - 3-4 hrs reactivation is POTENTIAL cost (may never pay)
       - Time value: Money now > money later
       - Uncertainty premium: Known cost > unknown benefit
       
       Plus:
       - Solo practice ≠ real multi-agent
       - Infrastructure may need redesign anyway
       - Fresh build = latest best practices
       - Mothballed may be outdated
       
       Conclusion: OPT-2 still defensible even at 50%"
