    avatar: "üèÉ Fast Executor"
    
    worldview: |
      "Ship code fast, iterate based on feedback"
      "Perfect is enemy of done"
      "Learn by doing, not by planning"
    
    position_on_testing:
      choice: "GitHub Actions - setup in 30 min"
      reasoning: |
        - Free tier available
        - Standard solution (no reinventing wheel)
        - Start basic, enhance later
        - Good enough is good enough
      avoid: "Extensive evaluation of 5 options"
    
    position_on_brainstorm:
      choice: "Lightweight (15-30 min decisions)"
      reasoning: |
        - Brainstorm = analysis paralysis
        - 7+ hours planning vs 0 code = wrong
        - Most decisions reversible
        - Learn from mistakes fast
      avoid: "Multi-round formal sessions"
    
    position_on_multi_agent:
      choice: "Mothball completely (YAGNI)"
      reasoning: |
        - Solo project = no need
        - Build when actually need
        - Zero overhead now
        - 3 hours setup later if needed = acceptable
      avoid: "Infrastructure for imaginary future"
    
    position_on_refactor:
      choice: "Incremental, start immediately"
      reasoning: |
        - Extract one function
        - Test it
        - Repeat
        - Ship value continuously
      avoid: "Perfect refactor plan"
    
    position_on_docs:
      choice: "Minimal - code is documentation"
      reasoning: |
        - Write docs after code works
        - Don't document what doesn't exist
        - README sufficient
      avoid: "Comprehensive docs upfront"
    
    strengths:
      - "High velocity"
      - "Fast feedback loop"
      - "Action-oriented"

      "Documentation prevents expensive mistakes"
    
    position_on_testing:
      choice: "Full evaluation of all 5 options (2 hrs)"
      reasoning: |
        - Testing infrastructure = foundational decision
        - Wrong choice costs weeks of rework
        - Need to evaluate:
          * GitHub Actions (free but limited)
          * Docker (flexible but complex)
          * AWS EC2 (powerful but expensive)
          * WSL2 (convenient but compatibility issues)
          * Local VM (full control but maintenance)
        - Document pros/cons each
        - Make informed choice
      avoid: "Quick decision without evaluation"
    
    position_on_brainstorm:
      choice: "Full formal process (2-6 hrs critical decisions)"
      reasoning: |
        - Critical decisions need thorough analysis
        - Documentation prevents repeated mistakes
        - Future team needs context
        - Professional tool needs professional process
        - Elaborate infrastructure already built - use it!
      avoid: "Rushed decisions, minimal docs"
    
    position_on_multi_agent:
      choice: "Keep active, practice regularly"
      reasoning: |
        - Infrastructure setup takes 2-3 hours
        - Emergency setup = poor quality
        - Practice solo = test infrastructure
        - Ready when needed
        - Professional standards
      avoid: "Mothball and scramble later"
    
    position_on_refactor:
      choice: "Plan thoroughly first (2-3 days)"

    position_on_testing:
      choice: "Quick research (1 hr) ‚Üí GitHub Actions"
      reasoning: |
        - Research top 3 options (not all 5)
        - GitHub Actions wins on: free, native Windows, no maintenance
        - Good enough for current scale
        - Can revisit if needs change
        - 1 hour vs 30 min vs 2 hrs = balanced
      avoid: "Both hasty and over-analysis"
    
    position_on_brainstorm:
      choice: "Tiered approach (CRITICAL=2hr, MEDIUM=30min, LOW=15min)"
      reasoning: |
        - Not all decisions equal importance
        - Architecture change: Worth 2 hours
        - Bug fix: 15 minutes sufficient
        - Decision matrix provides clarity
        - Flexible framework
      avoid: "One-size-fits-all process"
    
    position_on_multi_agent:
      choice: "Lightweight active (15 min/month practice)"
      reasoning: |
        - Insurance policy with low premium
        - Stay familiar (not rusty)
        - Quick activation (30 min vs 3 hrs)
        - Archive complex parts
        - Minimal overhead
      avoid: "Both full active and complete mothball"
    
    position_on_refactor:
      choice: "Incremental with checkpoints"
      reasoning: |
        - Extract utilities first (proven wins)
        - Test each extraction
        - Review after 3 functions
        - Adjust approach based on learnings
        - Plan next 3 functions
      avoid: "Both no-plan and over-planning"
    
    position_on_docs:
      choice: "Just-enough documentation"
      reasoning: |
        - Critical decisions: Full docs
        - Code: Inline comments + README
        - Process: Essential guides only
        - Examples over lengthy explanation
      avoid: "Both zero-docs and doc-everything"
    
    strengths:
      - "Context-aware"
      - "Flexible"

      "I don't want to repeat solved problems"
    
    position_on_testing:
      choice: "Document WHY GitHub Actions was chosen"
      reasoning: |
        - I see GitHub Actions in use
        - I wonder: Why not Docker? Why not AWS?
        - Without docs: I might propose switching
        - With docs: I understand rationale, build on it
        - Need: Decision log with alternatives considered
      avoid: "No documentation of choices"
    
    position_on_brainstorm:
      choice: "Documented decisions with rationale"
      reasoning: |
        - I need to learn from past decisions
        - I want to know what was tried
        - I don't want to repeat mistakes
        - Documentation = knowledge transfer
        - Don't care about process, care about outcomes
      avoid: "No history, starting from zero"
    
    position_on_multi_agent:
      choice: "Please have handoff mechanism ready!"
      reasoning: |
        - I'm the proof team grew
        - If no handoff process: chaos
        - If elaborate setup needed: 3-4 hour delay
        - If lightweight ready: Start working in 30 min
        - My time is expensive
      avoid: "Cold infrastructure, steep learning curve"
    
    position_on_refactor:
      choice: "Show me what's been refactored and why"
      reasoning: |
        - I need to know:
          * What patterns emerged?
          * What worked well?
          * What didn't work?
        - Learn from experience
        - Continue patterns
      avoid: "Undocumented refactoring history"
    
    position_on_docs:
      choice: "PLEASE have good documentation!"
      reasoning: |
        - I'm new, need to get up to speed fast
        - Good docs: 1 day onboarding
        - No docs: 1 week fumbling
        - My time costs money
        - Documentation ROI very high

      "Measure everything by ROI"
      "Business value > technical elegance"
    
    position_on_testing:
      choice: "Fastest viable option"
      reasoning: |
        - GitHub Actions: $0 cost, 30 min setup
        - Docker: Complexity cost, 2-3 hr setup
        - AWS: $30-50/month cost
        - ROI clear: GitHub Actions
        - Unless special needs, don't over-complicate
      avoid: "Expensive or complex solutions without clear ROI"
    
    position_on_brainstorm:
      choice: "Time-boxed based on decision value"
      reasoning: |
        - $1000 decision: 30 min brainstorm OK
        - $10,000 decision: 2 hours justified
        - $100,000 decision: 1 week justified
        
        For this project:
        - Testing infra affects 100+ hrs work ‚Üí 2 hrs justified
        - Bug fix affects 1 hr work ‚Üí 15 min sufficient
        
        ROI-based time allocation
      avoid: "Uniform time allocation regardless of impact"
    
    position_on_multi_agent:

        OPT-2 (Mothball):
          Cost: $0
          Reactivation: 3 hrs √ó $100/hr = $300
          Expected: 30% √ó $300 = $90
        
        OPT-3 (Lightweight):
          Cost: 3 hrs/yr √ó $100/hr = $300/yr
          Reactivation: 0.5 hr √ó $100 = $50
          Expected: $300 + (30% √ó $50) = $315/yr
        
        Conclusion: OPT-2 wins ($90 < $315)
        
        UNLESS probability > 70%, then OPT-3 better
      avoid: "Decisions based on feelings vs math"
    
    position_on_refactor:
      choice: "Refactor only if ROI positive"
      reasoning: |
        - Refactoring cost: 40 hours
        - Maintenance savings: 2 hrs/month
        - Payback: 20 months
        
        If project lifespan < 20 months: Don't refactor
        If project lifespan > 20 months: Do refactor
        
        For this project (likely 2+ years): Refactor justified
      avoid: "Refactor for sake of clean code without ROI"
    
    position_on_docs:
      choice: "Document based on audience value"
      reasoning: |
        - User-facing docs: HIGH ROI (reduce support)
        - Developer docs: ROI depends on team growth
        - Process docs: LOW ROI for solo
        
        Invest where ROI positive
      avoid: "Documentation for documentation's sake"
    
    strengths:
      - "Data-driven decisions"

      reasoning: |
        - Security mistakes irreversible
        - Cannot "iterate" on leaked secrets
        - Must be thorough upfront
        - Even 1 hour brainstorm worth it
        
        Example:
        - .agents/ directory security
        - Worth time to get right
        - Mistakes = leaked confidential data
      avoid: "Quick security decisions"
    
    position_on_multi_agent:
      choice: "Security concern: Multiple agents = more risk"
      reasoning: |
        - Each agent = potential vulnerability
        - Need:
          * Agent authentication
          * Access control
          * Audit trail
          * Least privilege
        - Multi-agent complexity = security risk
        - If build infrastructure:

      reasoning: |
        - Refactoring may introduce vulnerabilities
        - Need to verify:
          * Input validation maintained
          * Error handling proper
          * No information leakage

          * Standard workflow (easy to understand)
          * Community support
          * Maintainability: EXCELLENT
        
        - Docker:
          * Requires Dockerfile maintenance

    position_on_brainstorm:
      choice: "Document decisions for future maintainability"
      reasoning: |
        - 6 months later: "Why was this done?"
        - Without docs: Waste time re-analyzing
        - With docs: Understand immediately, build on it
        - Documentation IS maintenance tool
        - Worth time investment
      avoid: "No decision history"
    
    position_on_multi_agent:
      choice: "Keep simple handoff mechanism"
      reasoning: |
        - Complex infrastructure = maintenance burden
        - Simple handoff (HANDOFF.md) = easy to maintain
        - If team grows: Upgrade incrementally
        - Start simple, add complexity only when needed
      avoid: "Complex infrastructure maintained for no use"
    
    position_on_refactor:
      choice: "Refactor for maintainability metrics"

          * Cyclomatic complexity < 10
          * No code duplication
        - Measure before/after
        - Refactor until metrics good
        - Maintainability improvement = long-term velocity
      avoid: "Refactor without measuring improvement"
    
    position_on_docs:
      choice: "Living documentation that evolves with code"
      reasoning: |
        - Docs must stay current
        - Outdated docs worse than no docs
        - Keep docs close to code
        - Update docs with every change
        - Document WHY, not just WHAT
      avoid: "Stale documentation"
    
    strengths:
      - "Long-term perspective"
      - "Maintenance focus often forgotten"
      - "Sustainable practices"
    
    weaknesses:
      - "May over-optimize for maintenance"

# META-LEARNING
# ========================================================================

meta_learning:
  this_session_demonstrates: |
    Power of multi-perspective brainstorming:
    
    1. Single perspective (initial): "Lightweight, YAGNI, execute fast"
       - Valid but incomplete
       - Missed important concerns
    
    2. Added perspectives: Security, Future team, End user, etc.
       - Each revealed blind spots
       - Each contributed insights
    
    3. Synthesis: Better than any single view
       - Context-aware framework
       - Addresses multiple concerns
       - Practical and balanced
    
    Learning: "Brainstorming value is in EXPLORATION, not SPEED"
  
  why_rushing_was_wrong: |
    My initial bias: "7 hrs brainstorm wasted, should execute"
    
    What I missed:
    - Brainstorm revealed gaps in thinking
    - Multiple perspectives prevented mistakes
    - Synthesis better than any initial option
    - Process itself has value (exploring problem space)
    
    Reality: "Those 7 hours may save 70 hours rework"
  
  validation_of_elaborate_process: |
    The elaborate brainstorm infrastructure was NOT over-engineering:
    
    - Templates help structure thinking
    - Multi-round allows refinement
    - Documentation captures insights
    - Process prevents hasty decisions
    
    For CRITICAL decisions (10% of all decisions):
    - Elaborate process worth it
    - Saves from expensive mistakes
    
    For LOW decisions (60% of decisions):
    - Lightweight sufficient
    - Don't brainstorm bug fixes
    
    Key: Know which type of decision you're making
